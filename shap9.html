    <h1>Honda Odyssey</h1>
       <p>
        The Honda Odyssey, America's retail best-selling minivan, is reasserting its leadership for 2025 as the ultimate fun family vehicle with sporty new styling, more standard features and an updated cabin experience with technology improvements for the whole family. Arriving at Honda dealerships starting tomorrow, the 2025 Odyssey will be available in four very well-equipped trim levels, EX-L, Sport-L, Touring and Elite, with prices starting at $41,920 (excluding a $1,395 destination and handling charge).
    </p>
    <p>
        What's New for 2025?

        The enhanced appearance of the 2025 Odyssey includes a sporty new grille, and reshaped front and rear fascias that accentuate Odyssey's wide stance. For a more premium, aspirational look, the aggressive new front facia features larger black fog light surrounds and the redesigned rear bumper integrates the same vertical reflectors used on the second-generation Acura NSX supercar.
        
        Every 2025 Odyssey also receives sharp new wheel designs, including the top-of-the-line Elite, which gets new machine-finished 19-inch alloys. Additionally, two attractive new colors are available: striking Solar Silver Metallic and Smoke Blue Pearl.

    <h1>Kia Carnival</h1>
    <img src="shap94.jpg" id="imagee">
   
    <p>
        At the 2024 Chicago Auto Show, the refreshed 2025 Kia Carnival multi-purpose vehicle reaffirmed itself as a trailblazer in the minivan segment, bringing a distinct edge in the space between SUV and family hauler. Commanding attention with a grand SUV-like design while offering up exceptional passenger and cargo space more akin to a van, the Carnival expands its versatility with an available turbo-hybrid powertrain. Brimming with Kia's next-generation of connected car technology, the Carnival steps into the digital age with connectivity and convenience at its core.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The Carnival has been a standout since its introduction, effortlessly blending SUV aesthetics with the utilitarian functionality of a family vehicle," said Steve Center, COO and EVP. "As a brand that refuses to settle for the status quo, we've made impactful updates across styling, performance and technology, further allowing the Carnival to challenge stereotypes that family vehicles are uninspiring."

The 2025 Carnival will be available in five trim levels (LX, LXS, EX, SX, SX Prestige), while the Kia Carnival HEV will be available in four trim levels (LXS, EX, SX, SX Prestige) when it goes on sale (expected summer 2024).
