    <h1> Ferrari 12 Cilindri</h1>
       <p>
        The Ferrari 12Cilindri is a two-seater grand tourer with a 6.5L V12 engine (F140 HD) producing 830 hp at 9,250 rpm and 678 Nm of torque at 7,250 rpm. It accelerates from 0-100 km/h in 2.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph). The car features rear-wheel drive, an 8-speed automatic transmission, and a dry sump lubrication system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design pays homage to the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, with a 2-door coupé body style and active and passive aerodynamics to enhance performance. The interior is inspired by the Purosangue and 296 GTB, and it's the first GT-segment Ferrari to lack an analog gauge.

    <h1>Ferrari KC23</h1>
    <img src="ferrari4" id="imagee" >
    <p>
        The Ferrari KC23 is a bespoke, one-of-a-kind supercar that emerged from Ferrari’s Special Projects program in 2023. This exclusive creation is a testament to Ferrari's commitment to innovation, performance, and aesthetic excellence. The KC23 blends the rigorous engineering and track prowess of Ferrari's GT cars with the elegance and sophistication of their road cars. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Designed by Flavio Manzoni and his team at the Ferrari Styling Centre, the KC23 showcases a unique design language. It features fluid lines and a dynamic stance that evoke both speed and elegance. One of the most striking aspects of the KC23 is its Gold Mercury paint, a color that exhibits a chameleon-like ability to change shades depending on the lighting conditions. This paint adds to the car's allure, making it a visual masterpiece.
