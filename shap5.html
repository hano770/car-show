    <h1>BMW i5 Touring </h1>
       <p>
        The BMW 5-Series Touring, the epitome of driving pleasure, sporty elegance and modern functionality in the premium upper mid-range segment, is entering a new era. With numerous digital innovations and - as the BMW i5 Touring - an all-electric drive for the first time, it represents progress in the BMW Group's key fields of the future in a further vehicle class. Sustainability throughout the entire product life cycle is enhanced by the consistent electrification of the drive portfolio and a production process that is more focused than ever on resource conservation and recycling. The latest generation of the BMW iDrive display and control system, new digital services and pioneering systems for automated driving and parking also underline the company's technological expertise in the new BMW 5-Series Touring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now in its sixth generation, the BMW 5-Series Touring presents itself more than ever as a cultivated all-rounder with an elegantly distinctive design, inspiring sportiness, versatility and spacious comfort in a progressive premium ambience. The exterior dimensions of the new BMW 5-Series Touring are slightly larger than those of its predecessor, emphasising its dynamically stretched proportions and increasing the amount of space available in both rows of seats.

    <p>
        The Audi A6 e-tron concept debuted at the Auto Shanghai 2021 trade fair as the forerunner of an innovative family of all-electric volume models. Audi is now launching the A6 e-tron as a Sportback and Avant. As the second model on the PPE platform, the upper mid-size vehicle picks up on the familiar product strengths of performance, range, efficiency, and charging. It is also the platform's first model with a flat floor concept. The exterior is powerful, sporty, and perfectly proportioned. Audi's new design philosophy defines the interior. Depending on the equipment level, the A6 e-tron offers many innovative features, such as second-generation virtual exterior mirrors, a panoramic glass roof that becomes opaque at the touch of a button and illuminated rings at the rear. The A6 e-tron and S6 e-tron can be ordered from September 2024 as Sportback and Avant versions.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The A6 e-tron is the first purely electric Audi model available as a Sportback and Avant," says Gernot Döllner, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG. "Its striking design enables the best aerodynamics in the portfolio and therefore greater efficiency. It will inspire enthusiasm for e-mobility with its long range of well over 700 kilometers and outstanding driving dynamics.
