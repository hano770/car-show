        Designed by Flavio Manzoni and his team at the Ferrari Styling Centre, the KC23 showcases a unique design language. It features fluid lines and a dynamic stance that evoke both speed and elegance. One of the most striking aspects of the KC23 is its Gold Mercury paint, a color that exhibits a chameleon-like ability to change shades depending on the lighting conditions. This paint adds to the car's allure, making it a visual masterpiece.
