    <h1> Chevrolet Silverado HD</h1>
       <p>
        We've designed the Silverado HD to be our customers' favored choice for true truck capability," said Scott Bell, vice president of Chevrolet. "The enhancements to the 2024 model build on its core strengths to provide an even stronger balance of the design, strength and confidence that makes tackling the hard jobs, including trailering, easier and more convenient than ever."
      </p>
    <p>
      The lineup includes 2500HD and 3500HD models in Regular Cab, Double Cab and Crew Cab configurations. Dual-rear-wheel models are available on 3500HD and they support the lineup's highest trailering capacity: 36,000 pounds. The 2024 Silverado HD is available in Work Truck, Custom, LT, LTZ, and High Country trims. ZR2 will join the HD trim lineup later in the model year for the first time.

    <h1>Ram Heavy Duty</h1>

    <p>
      More than 70% of Ram heavy-duty customers opt for the diesel, and for 2025 we built on that demand and long-lasting durability with an improved Cummins engine coupled with a new eight-speed transmission," said Tim Kuniskis. "This is a very specific pickup segment that requires a powerful tool - every 2025 Ram 2500 we sell allows the potential of 1075 lb.-ft. of torque in every gear, for a 70% increase in torque delivery from the previous generation 2500.
      </p>
    <p>
      The 2025 Ram 2500 and 3500 Heavy Duty offers customers two engine options - the new 6.7-liter Cummins High-Output Turbo Diesel engine and the standard 6.4-liter HEMI® V-8 engine. The new Cummins Turbo Diesel engine and TorqueFlite HD eight-speed transmission upgrades enable 36,610 pounds of towing capability with a more fuel-efficient 3.42 rear axle ratio. Max towing was previously available only with a 4.10 axle ratio.
