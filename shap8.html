    <h1>Audi A3 Sportback</h1>
       <p>
        The Audi A3 heads into the 2025 model year with a sportier look, new design elements, and digital features. In addition to selectable daytime running light signatures, the ability to flexibly purchase vehicle functions any time ensures a high degree of personalization. In addition, the standard equipment has been significantly expanded and new materials have been used for enhanced comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
        More dynamic - more progressive - more emotional: This is how the A3 Sportback and Sedan present themselves following the model upgrade. The hexagonal, frameless Singleframe features a new structure that is noticeably flatter and wider. It dominates the front end and, in addition to the large angular side air intakes, clearly symbolizes the compact models' sporty character. The striking front spoiler connects the two and makes the Audi A3 appear lower. The same is true of the rear, which is sportier than ever with a new bumper and distinctive diffuser. The progressive design elements are particularly effective with the S line exterior, as they are partly inspired by the RS models.The expressive exterior colors District Green, Ascari Blue, and Progressive Red further strengthen the sporty look.

        Exterior design: Dynamic front end and hallmark BMW proportions

        The sporty aura of the BMW 1-Series is underlined in the latest model generation by typical BMW proportions: a long bonnet, a passenger cell set well back, a dynamically flowing roofline and a powerful rear end. The dimensions of the five-door model have changed only slightly compared to its predecessor. The exterior length of the new BMW 1-Series has increased by 42 millimetres to 4,361 millimetres, while the wheelbase is 2,670 millimetres. The vehicle width is 1,800 millimetres, while the height has increased by 25 millimetres to 1,459 millimetres.
